# Fletore-N
### The old author stopped developing Fletore. This fork tries to achieve eeverything he couldn't.
Fletore is an open-source text editor for Windows (NT, obviously) and \*NIX systems written in Free Pascal with [Lazarus IDE](https://lazarus-ide.org).
<br>
Fletore does not need to be installed, as it is distributed in a single file, but it creates a configuration file.<br><br>
Fletore uses the [Tango icon theme](http://tango.freedesktop.org).
<br>
## Important!
Fletore builds for Linux-aarch64, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris were not tested because the Fletore's author does not have machines with these operating systems and cannot virtualize them.
<br>
## Build from source
To build Fletore you need the [Lazarus IDE](https://lazarus-ide.org).<br>
To cross-compile Fletore you need Lazarus and [fpcupdeluxe](https://github.com/LongDirtyAnimAlf/fpcupdeluxe).

# This branch is **DEPRECATED.**
I am a dumbass and broke the theme engine when it was working. This branch is going to be helpful to see the actual improvements made by me while I was doing it and see how awful of a coder I am.
Further development will go in the other branch, until I finally establish a good-working engine. I do not know how well will it go, but maybe I'll even have to make 2 configs, or refurbish the 1 we have.

# Fletore
Fletore is a simple open-source text editor for Windows and \*NIX systems written in [Lazarus](https://lazarus-ide.org).
<br>
Fletore does not need to be installed. This program is distributed in a single executable file, but creates a configuration file.<br><br>

### Important information!
Fletore builds for Linux-aarch64, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris were not tested because the Fletore's author does not have machines with these operating systems and cannot virtualize them.
<br>
#
### How can I build Fletore from source?
To build Fletore you need the [Lazarus Development Environment](https://lazarus-ide.org).<br>
To cross-compile Fletore you need Lazarus and [fpcupdeluxe](https://github.com/LongDirtyAnimAlf/fpcupdeluxe).
